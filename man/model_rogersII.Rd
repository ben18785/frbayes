\title{Generate a Rogers II Model Function for Prey-Predator Simulation}
\usage{
model_rogersII()
}
\value{
A function that calculates the propensity of prey consumption based on the current
number of prey and a set of parameters. The returned function takes two arguments:
\describe{
\item{prey}{Numeric representing the current number of prey.}
\item{parameters}{A list containing the parameters for the model. Must include:}
\describe{
\item{a}{A numeric value representing the maximum rate of consumption.}
\item{h}{A numeric value representing the handling time.}
}
}
}
\description{
This function returns a model function based on the Rogers II model, where the rate of prey consumption
is described by a functional response that depends on the current number of prey and two parameters:
\code{a} (the maximum rate of consumption) and \code{h} (the handling time).
}
\details{
The Rogers II model is defined as:
\deqn{ \text{rate} = \frac{a \cdot \text{prey}}{1 + a \cdot h \cdot \text{prey}} }
where \code{a} is the maximum rate of consumption and \code{h} is the handling time.
}
\examples{
model <- model_rogersII()
parameters <- list(a = 0.2, h = 0.5)
model(10, parameters)  # Computes the rate of prey consumption for 10 prey

}
