\title{Generate a Type III Model Function for Prey-Predator Simulation}
\usage{
model_typeIII()
}
\value{
A function that calculates the propensity of prey consumption based on the current
number of prey and a set of parameters. The returned function takes two arguments:
\describe{
\item{prey}{Numeric representing the current number of prey.}
\item{parameters}{A list containing the parameters for the model. Must include:}
\describe{
\item{b}{A numeric value representing the maximum rate of consumption.}
\item{h}{A numeric value representing the handling time.}
}
}
}
\description{
This function returns a model function based on the Type III functional response model,
where the rate of prey consumption is described by a quadratic function of the
number of prey and two parameters: \code{b} (the maximum rate of consumption) and
\code{h} (the handling time).
}
\details{
The Type III model is defined as:
\deqn{ \text{rate} = \frac{b \cdot \text{prey}^2}{1 + b \cdot h \cdot \text{prey}^2} }
where \code{b} is the maximum rate of consumption and \code{h} is the handling time.
}
\examples{
model <- model_typeIII()
parameters <- list(b = 0.3, h = 0.7)
model(10, parameters)  # Computes the rate of prey consumption for 10 prey

}
